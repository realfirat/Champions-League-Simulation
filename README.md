# :soccer: The Champions League Simulation :soccer:

The Champions League simulation I made while learning the Python and OOP. Nothing serious :)

- There are 4 groups. Each group contains 4 teams. There are total 16 teams
- First two of each group make it to the qualifies
- Matches' scores are calculated by team's luck and power
- I used "PrettyTable" package for printing the groups properly

If you want to run the simulation, you can try it at Replit:
